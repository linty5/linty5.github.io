BEng@SYSU SE, MSc@CityU EE <br>
Guangzhou, China <br>
<font color='Orange'>Hi! I am looking for a PhD position</font>

**Short Bio**
------
My name is Tingyu LIN, my name in Chinese is 林莛庾, you can call me "Timmy".<br>

I obtained the M.S. degree with **distinction** in multimedia information technology from [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2020 and the B.Eng. degree in software engineering from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2019. 

I have worked as an Image Engineer at Camera R & D department, [Autel Robotics](https://www.autelrobotics.cn/), developing image algorithms for cameras using C++, and also designing a prototype multispectral imaging system for large drones. After that, I have worked as a Deep Learning Algorithm Engineer at Research department, [WOODMAN AI](https://www.woodman-ai.com/), a Shanghai-based startup, focusing on industrial defect detection and 3D imaging systems.

**Research Interests**
------
My research interests include computer vision, computational photography, and deep learning. My main research goal is to develop improved deep learning methods with a clear motivation from real-world problems, especially in industrial applications, in order to achieve intelligence in robot vision. I approach this goal through image representation learning, and deep generative modeling.
