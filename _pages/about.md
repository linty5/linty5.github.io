**Short Bio**
------
My name is Tingyu LIN, my name in Chinese is 林莛庾, you can call me "Timmy".<br>

I obtained the M.S. degree with **distinction** in multimedia information technology from [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2020 and the B.Eng. degree in software engineering from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2019. <br>

I have worked as an Image Engineer at Camera R & D department, [Autel Robotics](https://www.autelrobotics.cn/), developing image algorithms for cameras using C++, and also designing a prototype multispectral imaging system for large drones. After that, I have worked as a Deep Learning Algorithm Engineer at Research department, [WOODMAN AI](https://www.woodman-ai.com/), a Shanghai-based startup, focusing on industrial defect detection and 3D imaging systems.<br>

I am now as a predoctoral researcher at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/), [Institute of Visual Computing & Human-Centered Technology](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/), [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/), Austria. I am currently conducting research for the FWF doctoral program "Visual Analytics and Computer Vision Meet Cultural Heritage ([VaCoViCu](https://visual-heritage.fhstp.ac.at/))" under the supervision of [Prof. Robert Sablatnig](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/staff/robert-sablatnig/). This project is a collaborative effort with [Institute of Creative\Media/Technologies](https://icmt.fhstp.ac.at/en), [FH ST. PÖLTEN](https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en), and I am also under the supervision of [Prof. Wolfgang Aigner](https://icmt.fhstp.ac.at/en/team/wolfgang-aigner). My research primarily focuses on the automatic image analysis and visualization of historical photographs and amateur films with the goal of preserving our cultural heritage.
