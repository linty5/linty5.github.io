Deep Learning Algorithm Engineer <br>
WOODMAN AI, Industrial Defect Detection <br>
Shanghai, China

**Short Bio**
------
Tingyu LIN's name in Chinese is 林莛庾, you can call him "Timmy".<br>

Tingyu LIN is a Deep Learning Algorithm Engineer at WOODMAN AI, a Shanghai-based industrial defect detection startup. Before that, He obtained the M.S. degree with **distinction** in multimedia information technology at the City University of Hong Kong in 2020 and the B.Eng. degree in software engineering at Sun Yat-sen University in 2019. 

**Research Interests**
------
My research interests include computer vision, computational photography, and deep learning. My main research goal is to develop improved deep learning methods with a clear motivation from real-world problems, especially in industrial applications, in order to achieve intelligence in robot vision. I approach this goal through image representation learning, and deep generative modeling.
